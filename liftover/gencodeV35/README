Analysis of percentage of gene intervals preserved when lifting from GRCh38
to CHM13v2.0 and back again

We compared gencodeV35 intervals from the GRCh38 primary assembly chromosomes,
lifted from GRCh38 to chm13v2 using two different candidate chain files, with
Liftoff intervals generated directly on the chm13 reference. The chain
files were generated either with minimap2 and v1_nflo ("v1_nflo"), or with the
wfmash-based pipeline ("v1_wfmash").

The gencodeV35 intervals on GRCh38 are available here:
http://t2t.gi.ucsc.edu/chm13/hub/t2t-chm13-v2.0/download/gencodeV35.bed.gz

We first filtered out intervals that are not on primary chromosomes:
gunzip -c gencodeV35.bed.gz | grep -v 'alt' | grep -v 'fix' | grep -v 'Un' | grep -v 'random' > gencodeV35.primary.bed
then kept only unique intervals (using the script filter_duplicate_intervals.pl)
so as not to overcount:
filter_duplicate_intervals.pl gencodeV35.primary.bed > gencodeV35.primary.unique.bed

The liftoff intervals were generated directly on chm13, and unique transcript
coordinates were obtained with the command:
grep -v '##gff-version' CHM13.liftoff.all.v2.gff3 | awk -F"\t" '$3=="transcript" && $5>$4 {print $1, $4-1, $5}' | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n | uniq > CHM13.liftoff.all.v2.transcript.unique.bed

We ran liftover using the syntax in the two scripts included here:
sh.lift_from_grch38_to_chm13v2
sh.lift_from_chm13v2_to_grch38

and compared lifted to original intervals with the commands in the four
"commands" file in this directory, one for each combination of the two
chain files and the two directions of lifting.

For example, for the use of v1_nflo and wfmash chain files to lift
GRCh38 gencodeV35 intervals to chm13v2, the counts were as follows:

Total intervals in gencodeV35 set: 224386
Number of intervals that UCSC liftOver reports as unmappable to chm13v2 (v1_nflo, then v1_wfmash):
 964 1181 #Deleted in new
 725  811 #Partially deleted in new
   0    1 #Split in new
Number of gencodeV35 intervals successfully created in chm13v2 (including multiples): v1_nflo 223259, v1_wfmash 222725
Number of lifted intervals which exactly match (chm13) liftoff intervals: v1_nflo 218420, v1_wfmash 218290
