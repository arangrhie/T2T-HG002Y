# IGV Session Files
IGV session files used to generate figures are provided for reproducibility of the figures.

## Load reference genome
### 1. Version from the T2T-Y paper
Go to `Genomes`, then `Load Genome from URL`: `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/chm13v2.0.json`.  
This will download the `chm13v2.0.json` file to your local IGV genomes, displaying T2T-CHM13v2.0 and its ideogram as the reference.  

### 2. Version hosted by broad
As an alternative option, it is possible to load the reference hosted by Broad Institute.  
Go to `Genomes`, then `Select Hosted Genomes`. Filter for `Human`. Use `Human (T2T CHM13-v2.0)`.  
Note this version automatically loads an older, preliminary version of the gene annotation.  

## Load sessions
Go to `Files`, then `Open Session...`.
